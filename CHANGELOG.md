# v1.2.1
Just a few changes, nothing too big (however, they are noticeable).
- Colors have been adjusted to match **(Discord's branding)[https://discord.com/branding]**. You are still able to change the colors, but this change was made for consistency sake.
- Icons now have colors depending on their indicator (parent) color.
- Updated README assets.

# v1.2.0
Some major adjustments and enhancements.
- Eveyrthing has been redone from scratch, which should make this loads better.
- Add more variables and better labeling; this should make customization a lot simpler.
- Added support for connection to a voice channel, incase anyone wanted color customization on those.

Please ignore the changes in version labeling. It may cause confusion since it seems like the version was downgraded, but please know this was intentional as I wanted to get rid of the unnecessary version jumps.
